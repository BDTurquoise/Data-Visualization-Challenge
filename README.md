# Data-Visualization-Challenge Resubmission
I received feedback from the Central Grader that my line graph was incorrect. I have fixed the graph and am resubmitting the assignment for grading.
Thank you.

### Analysis - Focus on Capomulin

The target project compiled data from a 45-day trial of drugs to treat squamous cell carcinoma in laboratory mice, with a focus on the efficacy of Capomulin. When considering the performance of Capomulin versus other treatment options, there are several important conclusions that can be drawn:

- Using the Box Plot graph, we see that the treatment group treated with Infubinol produced potential outliers. This could mean unusual treatment responses or measurement errors.

- When considering the linear regression model, we see a trend line with a positive slope. This indicates that as mouse weight increases, the average tumor volume increases as well. This correlation makes logical sense.

- The mean/median tumor volumes indicate that of the drugs being tested, Capomulin is in the top 20% in terms of effectiveness at reducing tumor volume.

- The low values for the volume variance and standard deviation indicate that there was a low amount of variability in how the tumors treated with Capomulin responded. Low variability in this case indicates a high degree of effectiveness.


### Conclusion

Capomulin demonstrates through the data that it is one of the most viable options for SCC treatment options. While Capomulin is one of the most viable options, the drug Ramicane did demonstrate through the key indicators that it performs slightly better than Capomulin for treating squamous cell carcinoma. The recommendation based on all data available is to focus on SCC treatment that utilizes either the Capomulin or Ramicane course of treatment.
